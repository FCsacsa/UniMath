# The bicategory of display map categories

## Direct vs. displayed version

`BicatOfDisplayMapCat.v` contains a direct construction with a terminal object in the base category.
Everything in that file is mirrored in the displayed version in `DispBicatOfDisplayMapCat.v`.
Therefore, the displayed version should be used, as it also contains extra definitions and theorems.
